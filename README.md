## Description

  NoSQL Social-Network-BackEnd API operates as a bare-bones model of a social media site and as an educational skeleton. Modeling the MVC paradigm, excluding the view of MVC, and utilizing technologies such as
  Mongoose and Node: NoSQL Social-Network-BackEnd API seeks to establish an accessible skeleton for future projects relating to social media. As well as educate Junior devs on the mechanics
  of the back end and Mongoose databases. Furthermore, this project also demonstrates how Mongoose virtuals are implemented.
